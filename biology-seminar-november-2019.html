We meet today on Treaty 4 lands, the territories of the Cree, Saulteaux (SOH-toh), Dakota, Lakota, Nakoda, and the homeland of the Métis Nation.

Today, these lands continue to be the shared territory of many diverse peoples.

One way to describe statistics is the principled process by which we learn from data in the presence of noise and uncertainty

We may have little or no theory to work with, so we take an empirical approach which may lead to the development of new theory

Learning from data involves trade offs

We can have models that fit our data well &amp;mdash; low bias &amp;mdash; but which are highly variable, or

We can fit models that have lower variance, but these tend to have higher bias, i.e. fit the data less well

A linear regression model is very interpretable but unless the underlying relationship is linear it will have poor fit

Deep learning may fit data incredibly well but the model is very difficult to interpret and understand

# The wibbly wobbly stuff  &amp;mdash; splines

GAMs use splines to represent the non-linear relationships between covariates, here `x`, and the response variable on the `y` axis.

Splines are built up from basis functions

Here I'm showing a cubic regression spline basis with 10 knots/functions

We weight each basis function to get a spline. Here all the basisi functions have the same weight so they would fit a horizontal line

---

# Weight basis functions &amp;rarr; spline

But if we choose different weights we get more wiggly spline

Each of the splines I showed you earlier are all generated from the same basis functions but using different weights

# Conclusions

Using the model we can show that:

1. The expected value of [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] was often &amp;gt; 299 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;mdash; esp. after 2010

2. The probability that [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] exceeded 299 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; was often high &amp;mdash; esp. after 2010

3. [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] increased markedly post 2008 &amp;mdash; **failure of the water quality objectives**

# Conclusions

* HGAMs are useful for modelling wiggly data from many climate stations

* Seasonal trends vary spatially and temporally

Central limit theorem shows us that the Gaussian or normal distribution is the sampling distribution for many sample statistics, including sample means, as samples sizes become large

* Evidence that the distribution of annual minima has changed in many lakes &amp;mdash; implications for future extreme events which have long-term knock-on effects
